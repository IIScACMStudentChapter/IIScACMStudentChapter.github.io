<p>Invited talk by <b> Prof. R. Ramanujam </b>, Professor,  Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai </p>


<h6>Title</h6>

<p> Why should we learn logic, and why should we learn logic?</p>

<h6>Abstract</h6>

<p>
Computer science curricula do not usually advertise the fact that computers, programming and models of computation all arose from trying to answer fundamental questions in logic. But is it only a matter of historical pride? Could learning logic actually be useful for those who actually do things (and not just theorize)? Even if that is true, should it not be sufficient for a few to write formulas and such, while most of us build "apps"? These are reasonable questions for a computer science student to ask, and the talk is an attempt to engage in a discussion with her.

<h6>Biography</h6>
<p>
R. Ramanujam got his BE (Hons) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani and his PhD in Computer Science from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. After postdoctoral research at the City University of New York, he has been at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai where he is currently Professor.

His research interests are in mathematical logic and theory of computation, and their applications to theory of distributed systems, game theory and security theory. He is currently on the editorial board of ACM Transactions on Computational Logic. In 2010, he was Lorentz Fellow of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies. He has been actively involved in the Indian Association for Research in Computing Science and the Associaton for Logic in India.

Ramanujam has been associated with the Tamil Nadu Science Forum since 1990, active in its involvement in science popularization and school education. He is editor of Thulir, a monthly science magazine for children. He was a member of the Yash Pal Committee that formulated the National Curriculum Framework 2005, and chaired the National Focus Group on Teaching of Mathematics, NCERT. Currently he is Vice President of the Mathematics Teachers Association of India, and a member of the Core Committee of CS Pathshala, an ACM India initiative.
