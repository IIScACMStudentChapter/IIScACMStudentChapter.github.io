<h6>Title</h6>

<p> Doing your life's work</p>

<h6>Abstract</h6>

<p>
The rapid evolution of technologies within and outside a company deeply affect the choice of work we intend to do as our life's work. As a case study, in this talk, I will give a high-level overview of technologies developed in NVIDIA, and the backdrop in which these technologies evolved. Further, I will give a birdâ€™s eye view of the implications of the dynamic settings in the current day workplace to doing our life's work.
